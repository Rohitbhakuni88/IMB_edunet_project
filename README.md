## IBM_edunet_project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to forecasting rainfall using a comprehensive dataset from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The dataset encompasses a decade's worth of daily weather observations, including metrics like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed. The goal is to predict the likelihood of rain tomorrow ('RainTomorrow') based on today's weather conditions.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Python: For data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data handling and numerical computations.
- Scikit-Learn: For implementing various machine learning algorithms.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data and results.

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
- **Weather Forecasting**: Useful for meteorologists and weather forecasting agencies.
- **Risk Management**: Assists in planning and decision-making processes for sectors dependent on weather conditions, like agriculture and logistics.
